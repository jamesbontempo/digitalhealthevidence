                <p><a href="/">Digital Health Evidence</a> was designed and developed, and is actively maintained, by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbontempo/">James BonTempo</a>. James was a member of the Knowledge for Health (K4Health) team that built the original mHealth Evidence site. When the K4Health project ended, mHealth Evidence was no longer actively maintained. Also, in the intervening years, the focus of the field has expanded beyond mHealth to the much broader Digital Health.</p>
                <p>Much like its predecessor, Digital Health Evidence is built on top of PubMed, but narrows its collection down to articles relevant to Digital Health. It also provides a few "Quick Searches" that make it easy to retrieve evidence on key topics. And of course, users can write their own queries to retrieve whatever evidence is most relevant to them.</p>
                <p>If you're a developer and are interested in looking at or contributing to the code base, you can find <a href="https://github.com/jamesbontempo/digitalhealthevidence">Digital Health Evidence on GitHub</a>.
